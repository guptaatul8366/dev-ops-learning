# What is Docker?

Docker is a containerization platform that packages an application and its dependencies into a container.

## Why Docker?
- Consistent environments
- Fast deployments
- Lightweight compared to VMs
- Ideal for CI/CD pipelines

## Docker vs Virtual Machines
Docker shares host OS kernel, while VMs require full OS.
