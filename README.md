## 🎯 Goal

To build strong practical skills in DevOps and Cloud technologies and prepare for DevOps Engineer roles.

## 📡 Networking Fundamentals

Networking is a core foundation for DevOps, Cloud, and Security.

**Topics covered:**
- OSI Model & ISO standards
- IP Addressing (IPv4, Public vs Private IP)
- Common Protocols & Ports (HTTP, HTTPS, SSH, DNS)
- TCP vs UDP
- Linux Networking Commands for troubleshooting

## 🐳 Docker & Containers

- Containerization using Docker
- Docker commands & Dockerfile
- Multi-container applications using Docker Compose
- VProfile multi-tier application on containers
- Microservices architecture & projects

## 🐚 Bash Scripting & Automation

Bash scripting is used for automating repetitive tasks and managing Linux servers in DevOps environments.

**Topics & Hands-on Work:**
- Bash scripting fundamentals (VM-based lab)
- Variables, command-line arguments, quotes & command substitution
- User input, decision making, and loops (for / while)
- System monitoring scripts
- Remote command execution using SSH
- SSH key-based authentication for passwordless access
- Automated multi-node website deployment using Bash and SSH

**Final Automation Project:**
- Deployed 3 different website templates on 3 different VMs (web01, web02, web03)
- Used variables and loops to avoid repetitive code
- Downloaded templates using `wget`, extracted using `unzip`
- Executed deployments remotely from a control node (scriptbox)

## 🤖 AI for Scripting

- Used AI tools for Bash scripting assistance
- Autocomplete and syntax support
- Applying best practices and code improvements
- Reviewing AI-generated suggestions
- Writing and validating scripts with AI assistance
